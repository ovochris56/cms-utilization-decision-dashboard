##Executive Summary

CMS Utilization Decision-Support Dashboard
This dashboard uses publicly available CMS utilization data to help healthcare and public health leaders quickly identify high-volume procedures, utilization patterns, and providers operating at consistently high utilization percentiles relative to peers.
The goal is not reporting for reporting’s sake. The goal is decision support.
What This Dashboard Answers
This dashboard is designed to answer three core leadership questions:
Where is utilization concentrated?

By visualizing total procedures across common CMS-covered services, leaders can immediately see which procedures drive the majority of volume and system burden.


Which procedures and providers show unusually high utilization?

- Utilization percentiles surface procedures and providers operating well above national norms, helping distinguish routine volume from potential outliers.


Where should attention, audits, or policy review be prioritized?

- By combining utilization percentiles with total procedure counts, the dashboard highlights high-impact areas where oversight, reimbursement review, or care redesign may have the greatest return.


Key Insights Enabled

- High-volume procedures can be separated from low-impact noise
- Procedures with consistently elevated utilization percentiles become immediately visible
- Providers with both high volume and high utilization percentile emerge as priority candidates for further review
- Leaders can move from anecdotal concerns to data-backed prioritization


##How Leaders Use This

This dashboard is designed for:

- Executive and director-level review meetings
- Program oversight and utilization management
- Policy evaluation and planning discussions
- Supporting data-driven conversations with auditors, funders, or regulators


Rather than digging through spreadsheets or static reports, leaders can interactively explore utilization patterns and focus attention where it matters most.

##Why This Matters
- Healthcare organizations often have data, but not clarity. This dashboard replaces guesswork with visibility, enabling faster, more confident decisions around utilization, risk, and resource allocation.
