# CMS Utilization Decision Dashboard
CMS utilization analysis translated into a decision-support dashboard for healthcare and public health leaders.

CMS Utilization Decision-Support Dashboard

Overview
This project demonstrates how publicly available CMS utilization data can be transformed into a decision-ready dashboard for healthcare and public health leadership.

The focus is not technical novelty, but clarity: helping leaders quickly understand where utilization is concentrated, where it is unusually high, and where attention may be prioritized.

The Problem
Public health and healthcare organizations often have access to CMS data but lack clear, actionable visibility. Data is fragmented across spreadsheets and static reports, making it difficult to identify high-impact utilization patterns or communicate insights to leadership.

The Solution
This dashboard combines:
	- Total procedure volume
	- Utilization percentiles relative to peers
	- Provider-level patterns

to support more efficient, and confident decisions around utilization management, oversight, and policy review.

What Leaders Can Do With This
	- Identify high-volume procedures driving system burden
	- Surface procedures and providers operating at elevated utilization percentiles
	- Prioritize review, audits, or programmatic interventions
	- Replace static reporting with interactive decision support

  Assets
	- Dashboard: Power BI utilization dashboard (screenshot in repo)
	- Executive Summary: One-page overview for leadership audiences
	- Walkthrough: Short Loom video explaining how the dashboard is used in practice
