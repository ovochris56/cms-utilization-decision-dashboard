# CMS Utilization Decision-Support Dashboard

Decision-ready utilization analytics built from publicly available CMS data to help healthcare and public health leaders prioritize follow-up, oversight, and utilization review.

---

## What this is
This project transforms CMS utilization data into an executive-facing Power BI dashboard designed for **fast interpretation and action**.

The goal is not technical novelty. The goal is clarity:
- Where utilization is concentrated
- Where utilization is unusually high relative to peers
- Which procedures/providers merit deeper follow-up review

---

## What decisions this enables
Leaders can use this dashboard to:
- Identify high-volume procedures driving operational burden
- Surface provider-level outliers without assuming intent or wrongdoing
- Prioritize areas for review, audit, education, or policy attention
- Replace static reporting with interactive decision support
- Establish a baseline before deeper clinical, coding, or claims analysis

---

## Data source
[**Publicly available CMS utilization data**](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/n0yb-util#data-table) (aggregated, non-identifiable).

This project uses **non-identifiable, aggregated** data for demonstration and decision-support purposes.

## Dashboard contents
### Key metrics (examples)
- Total procedures
- Total providers (NPI-based where applicable)
- Procedure-level concentration
- Utilization percentile indicators (peer-relative positioning)
- High-utilization thresholds and outlier flags

### Pages (recommended structure)
- **Executive Summary**: KPIs + top signals + fastest “what changed / where to look”
- **Procedure View**: volume leaders + concentration
- **Provider View**: outliers + percentile distribution
- **Drilldowns**: specialty/location/time (if included)

---

## Method (high level)
- **Data preparation:** cleaning, standardization, and KPI setup
- **Modeling:** structured tables to support filtering and drill-down
- **Measures:** KPI definitions focused on leadership interpretation
- **Visualization:** executive-friendly layout for prioritization and follow-up discussion

---

## Deliverables
- **Power BI Dashboard:** screenshots 
- **Executive Summary (PDF):**

## Limitations & responsible use
This dashboard is designed for **pattern detection and prioritization**, not conclusions.
- Utilization patterns **do not imply causality** or clinical appropriateness
- Outliers **do not imply fraud** or wrongdoing
- CMS data may include coding differences, coverage effects, and reporting limitations
- Results should be interpreted as a starting point for deeper review
